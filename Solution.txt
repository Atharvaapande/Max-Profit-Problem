For the given test cases, the optimal combinations of properties and their earnings are:

- **Time Unit 7:**
  - Solution: 1 Pub (P)
  - Earnings: $3000

- **Time Unit 8:**
  - Solution: 1 Theatre (T)
  - Earnings: $4500

- **Time Unit 13:**
  - Solution: 1 Theatre (T)
  - Earnings: $12000

The expected earnings for the 13-time unit case were $16500, but the calculated earnings were $12000. This discrepancy suggests that there might be a need to re-evaluate the logic or constraints in the solution.
